# Etch-a-Sketch

## A Javascript project for the Odin Project

Draws a grid (64x64 by default) of squares then fills in the squares when you mouse over.

### 3 Modes:

* **Default** = Black squares.
* **Colourful** = A random colour is used for each square.
* **Gradient** = Starts with white and progresses through to black in gradients each time you mouse over the same square.

You are asked how big the grid should be each time you select an option - populated by default with 64 to draw a 64x64 grid.
